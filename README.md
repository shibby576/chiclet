# Q&A system for video transcripts

The purpose of this project to is find interesting ways to leverage llms to interact with new content and for me to learn a thing or two along the way. 

This project currently collects the transcript of a youtube video, turns it into a vector DB (FAISS) embedded with OpenAI, then leverages the embeddings to respond to the query. It also leverages custom prompts to keep the agent on topic.
